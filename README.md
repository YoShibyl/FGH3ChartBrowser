## How to use
Requires a Windows PC capable of running FastGH3 and this program.

1) Make sure that FastGH3 is installed, preferably to `C:\Program Files (x86)\FastGH3`.  If installed elsewhere on your PC, click the **Browse for FastGH3.exe** button.
2) Click the **Browse for Folder** button to select the folder containing your songs.  At the moment, it's only possible to scan one folder, unfortunately.
3) Click **Scan Songs** and be patient.  This can take somewhere between a few seconds and minute(s), depending on how many songs you have and how fast your PC is.
4) You can type in the Filter Songs bar to search by title, artist, album, genre, chart author, and even the file path of the chart.
5) Click the song you want to play, then click the big ol' **Play Selected Song** button, and rock on!

## Planned features
- ~~An option to quickly access FastGH3's settings menu (should be easy to add)~~ DONE
- Storing scan results for later
- ~~Scanning for `.sng` files (soon?)~~ DONE
- A better way to visualize song data, such as album art and other metadata *(WIP)*
